I am recreating a graph from a data set looking at the patterns in which otters juggles rock and other things in their environment and how its relates to their survival based functions   
![](pictures/graph to recreate 1.gif)


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(patchwork)

Otter<- read.table(file="Puzzle_data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(Otter)

table(Otter$species)
Otter$species <- factor(Otter$species, labels=c("ASC", "SCO")) 

hope<- ggplot(data=Otter,
              aes(x=species, y=latency, fill= puzzle.type)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.color= "black", outlier.shape=16, outlier.size=2, notch=FALSE) +
  ylab("Latenency to First Interactions(s)")
hope + theme_classic(base_size=14, base_family="Times") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="puzzle type")) +
                                                                   scale_fill_grey()
    
  

```
