# <span style="color: bisque;">Welcome </span>  
<span style="color: green;"> Hey y'all. Thanks for stopping by my page for a little minute. This is my first ever webpage made for my 23' J-term course: Reproducible in R. We're learning how to maneuver the statistical program R/Rstudio. This page serves as a culmination of my work throughout the pseudo-semester. Enjoy:) </span>
