# Working with matrices, lists, and data frames

1. Assign to the variable n_dims a single random integer between 3 and 10
```{r}
n_dims <- round(runif(1, min=3, max=10))
n_dims

#consecutive integers
n_dims2 <- seq(from=1, to=n_dims^2)  
n_dims2
#reshuffle
#sqre matrix
m <- matrix(data = sample(n_dims2), nrow=n_dims)
print(m)
#transpose
m2<- t(m)
print(m2)
# It has changed by havign the rows become the columns when transposed
#sum & mean of m
sum(m[1,])
sum(m[n_dims,])
mean(m[1,])
mean(m[n_dims,])
#sum and mean of m2
sum(m2[1,])
sum(m2[n_dims,])
mean(m2[1,])
mean(m2[n_dims,])

```
